# Fin-REER

This is the master folder which contains code for labelling functions and appliers

## applier

We will add the code for custom applier functions in "apply" folder

## labeling functions

Labeling functions are categorized in three categories namely entity, event and relationship. Please add your labeling functions in respected folder. 

Follow the following naming convention for labeling function.  
label\_< name of entity, relationship or event >\_< library/heuristic/model >\_< name of library or keyword for heuristic >
 - < name of entity, relationship or event >: example loc, per, org
 - < library/heuristic/model >: mostly in our case it will be heuristic
 - < name of library or keyword for heuristic >: if you are using some package or model specify name, for heuristic just a keyword to identify function
